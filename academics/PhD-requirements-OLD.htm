            <div class="mainContent">
              <p class="heading">Doctor of Philosophy</p>
                <p class="content">The Ph.D. Program at the Institute of Fine Arts is a course of study designed for the person who wants to investigate the role of the visual arts in culture through detailed, object-based examination as well as historical and theoretical interpretation. The degree program provides a focused and rigorous experience supported by interaction with the leading scholars of the Institute, and access to New York area museums, curators, conservators, archaeological sites and NYU’s global network.&nbsp; </p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Full-time Study</span><br>
                  The program is designed for up to six years of full-time, funded study, including tuition and fees, student health insurance, and a stipend. A total of 18 courses (72 points) are required for the Ph.D. degree. Students register for three courses (or 12 points) per semester for the first six semesters. One course in the fifth semester is dedicated to research toward a dissertation topic. In the sixth semester, students register for points devoted to preparing for their major examinations. Exceptions to full-time study are made only for urgent financial or medical reasons and must have the approval from the Director of Graduate Studies.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <span class="strong">Students Entering with a Master’s Degree</span><br>
                  To receive the Ph.D. degree, all Institute requirements must have been fulfilled, including a Master’s thesis (of copy of which is submitted with the application), and a distribution of courses within areas of study that correspond to those outlined in Distribution Requirements. No credits will be automatically transferred; transferred points and distribution credit will be awarded based upon evaluation by the Institute Faculty at the First Year Review. </p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">Course Definitions </span></p>
                <p class="content"><span class="strong">Proseminar</span>: The purpose of the Proseminar is to introduce students in the doctoral program to advanced research methods in the history of art. Because it is a dedicated course for the entering Ph.D. students, it will serve to consolidate the cohort. It is taken during the first semester and is taught by a rotation of the Institute faculty, with a different faculty member chosen each year. Emphasis is placed on the specific practices of art-historical analysis in relation to visual and textual interpretation. The contents of the seminar vary each year according to the research interests of the chosen instructor. The class is structured around specific problems in the history of art rather than broad conceptual paradigms, with an emphasis on historical interpretation.</p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">Colloquium: </span>A colloquium provides an analysis or overview of the state of the literature on a given art historical topic or problem, with extensive reading, discussion, and presentations. There may be a final paper.</p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">Seminar: </span>A seminar is a focused advanced course that explores a topic in depth and requires substantial original research from the student. Seminars are often based on exhibitions or collections in the New York area. Students are expected to produce at least one substantial paper.</p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">Lecture: </span>Lecture courses explore topics or historical periods, giving overviews of major issues as well as detailed analysis of specific problems and works of art. Students are responsible for assigned and recommended reading, and may produce short papers and/or take an exam.</p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">Distribution Requirements</span><br>
                  Students must take at least one seminar in four fields outside of their area of specialization. The Proseminar may count as one of these seminars. Students are required to take one course in technical studies of works of art. Students may take courses in other relevant disciplines in consultation with their advisor, and subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies.                </p>
              <p class="content">Distribution requirements are met by choosing courses in the following fields:</p>
            <p class="content">1. Pre-modern Asia<br>
                  2. Pre-modern Africa and the Middle East<br>
                  3. The Ancient Mediterranean and Middle East, including Egypt<br>
                  4. Pre-modern Europe and the Americas<br>
                  5. Post-1750 Global<br>
                  6. Museum and Curatorial Studies<br>
                  7. Technical Studies of Works of Art<br>
                  8. Architectural History</p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Language Requirement</span><br>
                  Students are required to demonstrate reading proficiency in two modern languages relevant to their area of specialization, and may be expected to learn other languages that will equip them for advanced research in their chosen fields. &nbsp;</p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Qualifying Paper</span><br>
                  The Qualifying Paper may be developed from seminar work or might be on a topic devised in consultation with the student’s advisor. Normally, the student will be advised to produce a detailed study on a subject that leads towards the dissertation. It should be no longer than 10,000 words (excluding bibliography and footnotes) and completed prior to the beginning of the third year of study. Once the Qualifying Paper has been passed by two faculty members, the student will receive the M.A. degree. </p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Orals</span><br>
                  Ph.D. students are examined on a major field consisting of two contiguous areas and a third component that can be in a related field providing skills for their dissertation. Students should consult their advisor in selecting their examiners and fields for oral examination. </p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Dissertation Proposal</span><br>
                  The proposal must be presented to a dissertation committee no later than six months after passing the major oral and written examinations. In exceptional cases a student may present a proposal before their examinations. Students will discuss potential dissertation topics with their supervisor, who will form a dissertation committee of three faculty members (the supervisor and two others). The proposal will be distributed to the committee members in advance of a proposal presentation. <span class="strong"><br>
  </span><br>
  <span class="strong">Certificate in Curatorial Studies</span><br>
                  This program is offered jointly by the Institute of Fine Arts and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The purpose of the program is to prepare students for curatorial careers in specialized fields. Students who wish to obtain a Certificate must take two courses in Curatorial Studies, taught at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in addition to a nine-month internship, usually at The Metropolitan Museum. </p>
            <p class="content"><span class="strong">Funding</span> <br>
                  Funding from the Institute is conditional on continued full-time student status. Ph.D. students are funded for up to six years, depending on the transfer of previous graduate work. The program is normally divided into three years of course work, exams, and submission of a dissertation proposal and three years for dissertation research and writing. Variations to this pattern might occur according to opportunities for students to develop skills or experience in their specialist fields, as approved by the student’s advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies. Students are encouraged to compete for outside fellowships. IFA funding will be suspended during a period of equivalent outside fellowship support. The award of such fellowships may extend the number of funded years taken to complete the program.</p>
                <p class="content"><span class="strong">Teaching </span><br>
                  Students may work as teaching assistants and graders in NYU’s undergraduate departments beginning in their second semester. Students are encouraged to seek positions as primary instructors after passing the second year review. Opportunities for teaching at NYU and at other New York area colleges and universities will be coordinated by the Academic Office. Students pursuing paid work opportunities must consult the Academic Office before committing to any work (including teaching) which requires more than 20 hours per week.<br>
                  <br>
  <span class="strong">Time to Degree</span><br>
                  To remain in good standing, students must complete their degrees within specific time limits: If 24 or more credits are transferred toward the Ph.D degree, the degree must be completed within 7 calendar years after the date of first enrollment in that Ph.D, program. If fewer than 24 credits are transferred toward the Ph.D degree in any doctoral program, the degree must be completed within 10 calendar years after the date of first enrollment in that Ph.D. program.          </p>
