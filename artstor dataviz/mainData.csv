In between these main pattern elements we find small detached octagons filled with star-rosettes. The entire pattern is set against a brilliant red ground. The border design is developed from Kufic writing. In earlier examples, the actual letter forms are still preserved while in later examples, such as this, the design becomes balanced and purely decorative. For purposes of early identification, rugs of this design have become known as ""Holbeins"" as they appear in a number of paintings by the 16th century German master. The example illustrated is  typical in all respects but is quite unusual in its exceedingly pleasing balance of color, a combination of red, blue, and white. (McMullan, p. 236)",,,"J.

This pattern tradition survived into the 18th and even into the 19th century in Anatolia village rugs of which this is a powerful example. The two octagons that fill almost all of the field enclose a small octagon in the center from which radiate rectangular panels in a star-like fashion, filled with ""latch-hook"" patterns. The central octagon contains a star-and-knot design commonly found in ""Holbein"" rugs of the 16th century and used already in the 15th century. The balance of the field features rows of detached octagons with stars and rosette volutes in the corners which give a sense of movement to the otherwise compact and somewhat static design. The border pattern, although originally based on floral forms, is entirely broken up into geometric units. (McMullan, p. 310)",,,"J. McMullan, ""Islamic Carpets,"" pl. 103.
