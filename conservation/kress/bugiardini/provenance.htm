      <p class="content">The <span class="italic">Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist</span>, which was purchased by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1931 and given to the Allentown Art Museum in 1960, was for many yearserroneously documented as an early work in Bugiardini&rsquo;s <span class="italic">oeuvre</span>. Signed in gold with an elegantly abbreviated signature, <span class="italic">&ldquo;IVL.FL.F.&rdquo;</span> (<span class="italic">Julianus Florentinus Fecit</span>,), but not dated, it was believed to have been painted around 1510, not long after Raphael&rsquo;s <span class="italic">The Holy Family with a Palm Tree </span>and the unfinished <span class="italic">Esterhazy Madonna</span> in Budapest.&nbsp; Consequently the<span class="italic"> Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist</span>, in the <span class="italic">Galleria dell&rsquo;</span> Accademia in Florence, which is fully signed and dated, &ldquo;<span class="italic">JULIANUS FLORENTINUS FACIEBAT 1520</span>,&rdquo; was considered an elaboration of the subject of the Allentown painting, revisited by the artist a decade later. However, recently discovered 17th century archival material has identified the Allentown painting in the Oratory of the Church of Santa Maria di Galliera in Bologna, indicating that it was painted during the artist&rsquo;s Bolognese sojourn, between 1523 and 1525, and thus, the later of the two paintings.</p>

<p class="content">The earliest known mention of the Allentown painting was by the 17th century historian A. Masini in 1650 as, &ldquo;a small painting which decorates the altar of the Oratory [of Santa Maria di Galliera].&rdquo; The painting was still in the Oratory in 1803 when it was published in a guidebook of Bologna. In his travel diaries, the dealer and art historian Otto Mundler, noted that the painting was being offered for sale during his visit to Bologna on September 17, 1857, &ldquo;Palazzo Aldovadi contains some pictures for sale&hellip;Madonna di Gallier a picture recently discovered, Virgin and Child with S. John the Baptist. The infant child is breaking a fruit from a palm tree; S. John is extending his hands toward it. The figures are 2/3 size of life. -2 f. 8 &frac12; in. w. 3 f. 8 in. h. w &hellip; The picture has been recently restored. &ndash;For sale, but a large price demanded- Marked IVL.FL.F (the well known signature of Giulio Bugiardini).&rdquo; Otto Mundler was appointed by Sir Charles Eastlake, Director of the National Gallery of Art in London, to investigate new acquisitions. Perhaps based on Mundler&rsquo;s advice, Eastlake considered purchasing the painting in 1862, but ultimately did not.&nbsp; Sir Charles wrote: &ldquo;The head of the infant C(hrist) is so placed under a palm tree that the tree seems part of it&mdash;This might be rectified by making the gilding of the nimbus a little more conspicuous&mdash;the hair might also be brought down an inch &amp; half on the forehead &amp; the top of the head reduced&mdash;the nimbus would then also require to be brought lower.&nbsp; The same defect (too much forehead &amp; skull) is observable in the little St. John &amp; might be rectified&mdash;his body is also a little too thick&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eastlake&rsquo;s comments reveal a common 19th century attitude wherein the &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; of paintings is regarded as entirely legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unclear whether the painting was sold around that time or returned to the Oratory.&nbsp; At an unknown date, and for an undetermined period of time, the painting was exhibited in the Pinacoteca dell&rsquo;Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna, and included in the Pinacoteca&rsquo;s 1876 catalogue: &ldquo;Madonna and Child with Saint John signed &lsquo;IVL.FL.F,&rsquo; provenance, Oratory of the Church of Santa Maria Galliera.&rdquo; The painting had not appeared in previous catalogues nor was it present in subsequent ones. Based on the catalogue&rsquo;s description of the signature, the reference in Otto Mundler&rsquo;s travel diaries, as well as a reference by the nineteenth century art historian, Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, who in 1866 referred to the painting in the oratory of Santa Maria di Galliera as having the same subject as the version in Florence, it seems certain that the Allentown painting was in Bologna.</p>
<p class="content">Although it is uncertain when it left Bologna, in the late 19th century it belonged to Charles Fairfax Murray (1849-1919), a pre-Raphaelite painter who had settled in Florence, becoming a well-known dealer. The Dictionary of Art Historians includes this description: &ldquo;Fairfax Murray was a great influence in the art market, advising to numerous private and public collections in Europe and the United States. Lockett Agnew described him as &lsquo;the finest judge of art in the world.&rsquo; Edward Hutton claimed that during the late nineteenth century, Renaissance treasures were so plentiful that Murray would park himself on a cafe bench, and, pounding the bench with a stick, shout, &lsquo;Bring out your Madonnas! Two hundred lire!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave most of his paintings to the Dulwich Museum.&nbsp; There may have been an unrecorded intermediate owner before Alessandro Contini Bonacossi sold it to Samuel H. Kress in 1931</p>
