                  Around 1555 the Duke of Alba commissioned three life-sized bronze busts by the great Italian Renaissance portraitist Leone Leoni: one of himself and the other two of the Hapsburg emperor Charles V and the emperor&rsquo;s son, Philip II of Spain. Though the busts depict sitters of different rank—an emperor, a king, and a duke—Leoni presents them almost identically, as armored warriors in the cause of the Counter Reformation. For more than a century they have adorned the Guard Chamber at Windsor Castle, surrounded by actual weaponry and armor. Just as victorious Romans piled up the armor of their enemies as offerings to the gods, so George IV (who acquired the busts in 1825) turned these symbols of power into trophies of war.</p>

                  During the early Renasisance, Piero della Francesca&rsquo;s artistic talents were highly sought after by patrons across the Italian peninsula but nowhere more so than in his hometown of Borgo San Sepolcro. This lecture will explore how Piero gradually transformed the art of painting by applying his pioneering pictorial imagination to the challenge of three gothic polyptychs and by introducing Renaissance-format paintings into the domestic interior with his Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels (featured in the exhibition) and Nativity of Christ (The National Gallery, London). The latter work will be discussed in the context of architectural and pictorial decoration designed by Piero for his family&rsquo;s private palazzo.  This lecture is made possible by the Robert H. Smith Family Foundation</p>

                  Leonardo worked on a surprisingly small number of works—the <span class="italic">Mona Lisa </span>among them—refining and altering them over years. This method created a production bottleneck that could only be dealt with through delegating, leaving us with the problem of how we distinguish a fully autograph product from a painting made in the workshop. This lecture by Luke Syson (organizer of the triumphant exhibition <span class="italic">Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan</span>, at London's National Gallery) explores artistic production, collaboration, and delegation, and will track Leonardo's personal journey from a solitary artist to a collaborator working with pupils, assistants, and peers, and back.</p>

                  The late years of Leonardo da Vinci have often been minimized in comparison to his achievements in Florence and Milan. This may be because it's sometimes fashionable to consider an artist's production in old age past its prime or merely a replication of earlier, more successfully received work. In this talk, Carmen Bambach (who organized the Met's seminal 2003 exhibition <span class="italic">Leonardo da Vinci, Master Draftsman</span>) examines Leonardo's later years and the riches of his interior life and his concrete, multifaceted production as an artist-thinker. What lies at front and center in the work of Leonardo's old age is the unfinished dimension of his thought and production.</p>

                  More often celebrated as a painter, Piero della Francesca was also a pioneering mathematician. This lecture will discuss Piero&rsquo;s achievements as a mathematician, focusing on his precocious mastery of the teachings of the Greek geometrician Archimedes. Shortly after his death, Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, published two of Piero&rsquo;s treatises under his own name and conveyed Piero&rsquo;s knowledge of geometry to Leonardo da Vinci, who later became an expert in the subject.<br>

                  The landscapes in Piero&rsquo;s paintings, particularly his Baptism of Christ (National Gallery, London), are often thought to recall the area around his hometown of Borgo San Sepolcro. In truth, they evoke the upper Tiber Valley without describing it precisely. But what did it mean to locate sacred scenes in a recognizable and local setting?  Did that landscape carry any connotations for the fifteenth-century residents of Borgo San Sepolcro that might be lost to us today?<br>

                During a career spanning nearly sixty years, Piero della Francesca worked in almost every major center across the Italian peninsula although nowhere did he accept more commissions than in Borgo San Sepolcro. Like his native city, Piero&rsquo;s paintings are possessed of a character that is neither Florentine nor Sienese but entirely unique. On the closing weekend of the special exhibition, the show&rsquo;s curator will discuss Piero&rsquo;s career in Borgo and explore how some of his masterpieces created for that city reached American shores.                 </p>
