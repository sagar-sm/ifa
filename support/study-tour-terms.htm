              <p class="content"><span class="strong">CHANGES IN ITINERARY &amp; COSTS </span>The itinerary is subject to change at the discretion of the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) and AAA. All prices quoted are based on prevailing fuel prices, airfares and currency exchange rates in effect at time of brochure printing and are subject to change without notice. Deviations from the scheduled itinerary are at the expense of the individual. </p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">RESPONSIBILITY CLAUSE </span>The participation of IFA is limited to educational sponsorship of the program described in this brochure (The Program). AAA acts only as an agent for the participant with respect to transportation, accommodations and all other services, relating to The Program. AAA, IFA and/or their agents assume no responsibility or liabil­ity for any act, error or omission, or for any injury, loss, accident, delay or irregularity that may be occasioned by reason of any defect in any aircraft, ship, train, bus or other carrier, or through neglect or default of any sub­contractor or other third party, which may be used wholly or in part in the performance of their duty to the participants of The Program. The passage ticket issued by the carrier is the sole contract between the participant and the carrier. Nor will AAA or IFA and/or their agents be responsible for loss, injury, damages or expenses to persons or property, due to illness, weather, strikes, local laws, hostilities, wars, terrorist acts, acts of nature or other such causes in connection with The Program or anything beyond their reasonable control. AAA is not responsible for transportation or other pro­gram delays and changes, nor additional expenses or loss of time that may be incurred. In the event it becomes necessary or advisable for the comfort or well-being of the participants, or for any reason whatsoever, to alter the itinerary at any time, without notice to the participants, such alterations will be made without penalty to AAA or IFA. Additional expenses, if any, shall be borne by the participants. Baggage and personal effects are the sole responsibility of the participant at all times. IFA and AAA reserve the right to accept or decline any person as a participant at any time, or to require any participant to withdraw from The Program at their own expense when such an action is determined by AAA or IFA to be in the best interest of the participant&rsquo;s health and safety, or the general welfare of the other participants. </p>
              <p class="content"><span class="strong">CANCELLATION POLICY </span>AAA must strictly adhere to itscancellation policy to offset costs incurred prior to the commencement of The Program, which may include but are not limited to: advance payments to land operators; ship charters; communication expenses; development / promotional expenses and the loss of time that might have permitted resale of reserved space. All cancellations must be made in writing to the offices of AAA and are subject to a $350 non-refundable administrative fee. All refunds are limited to amounts actually received by AAA and are the sole responsibility of AAA; IFA shall have no liability for refunds. At the time AAA receives written notification of cancellation, the following cancellation charges will apply: cancellations received between 120 and 91 days prior to departure, 20 percent of the program cost per person; those received between 90 and 61 days before departure, 50 percent of the program cost per person; no refunds will be given for cancellations received within 60 days of departure. No refunds are given for cancellation on or after the day of departure, or for unused portions of the tour, for any reason. Air cancel­lation charges, if any, will be assessed in accordance with airline regulations. All group fare tickets must be issued no less than 30 days prior to departure. NOTE: Neither AAA nor IFA shall be liable for any airline cancellation penalties incurred by the purchase of a non-refundable ticket. In the case of a cancellation due to shortage of participants, AAA will attempt to notify all participants at least 45 days prior to departure. However, IFA reserves the right to cancel The Program prior to departure for any reason and, in such case, reimbursement of refundable costs of the trip by AAA shall constitute full settlement with the participant. In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between a participant and AAA or IFA, the following conditions will apply: (a) the dispute will be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in New York, NY; (b) the dispute will be governed by New York Law; (c) the maximum amount of recovery to which a participant shall be entitled under any and all circumstances will be the sum of all monies actually received from the participant by AAA. The participant agrees that this is a fair and reason­able limitation on the damages, of any sort whatsoever, that a participant may suffer. Upon payment of the deposit to AAA, the participant agrees to be bound by the above terms and conditions. </p>
