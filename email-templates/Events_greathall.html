  The Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to announce that the spring 2014 exhibition will feature works by the acclaimed sculptor <span class="strong">Rachel Harrison</span>.</p>
<p class="content"><img class="imagecontent" src="https://files.nyu.edu/jmv5/public/rachel-harrison-institute-of-fine-arts-nyu.jpg" alt="Lynda Benglis" width="300" height="450" align="left">Rachel Harrison (b. 1966, New York) is widely known for juxtaposing quotidian cultural materials and commercial objects into irregularly shaped, bulbous forms that confuse the boundaries between abstraction and figuration. In Harrison's work, the figure is often implied, but never explicit. Harrison's monuments are neither commemorative nor decorous. Instead, they are entrenched in a critical investigation of our contemporary culture.</p>
<p class="content">In <span class="italic">Party Line </span>(2014), a skeletal telephone booth, constructed from wood 2x4s, houses a black pay phone dangling aimlessly from its receiver. International calling cards are tacked to the structure's skeletal frame, prompting viewers to complete the action or perhaps linger for the missing caller to return. Similarly, the sculpture <span class="italic">American Bar </span>(2014) reveals a teamster's union jacket hanging on one side of a painted, rough hewn monolith, while a gold dish scrubber is affixed to its reverse. Both works on view at the IFA examine the contradictory states of absence and impending presence. Each artwork in Harrison's sculptural diptych is allegorically completed by the viewer, either by picking up the receiver or trying on the jacket. Harrison's work not only confirms the importance of the beholder, but the necessity for action in a critical society.<br>

  <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/events/great-hall-exhibitions.htm">The Great Hall Exhibitions</a> present two exhibitions per year showcasing prominent contemporary artists. Taking place in the fall and spring semesters, the expansive great hall of the Duke House, a historic landmark building, provides an impressive setting for displaying seminal contemporary art in the center of the IFA’s academic home and community. </p>
<p class="content"><span class="italic">The works on view for the spring 2014 Great Hall Exhibition are courtesy of the Artist and Greene Naftali, New York. This exhibition was made possible by the lead support received from Rachel Goodman Wilf and additional support from Linda Nochlin.</span></p>
