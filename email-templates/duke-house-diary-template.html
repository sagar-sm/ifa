<h3>June 2014</h3>
<h1>From the Director</h1>
<p>At last the season of sunglasses, sandals, and shorts is here! With classes no longer in session, the special summer quiet has settled on Duke House. Or rather a seeming quiet, since this is actually a very busy season for work on building maintenance, for budget submissions, for reviews of Institute operations, and for sorting out a myriad of academic matters. The Conservation Center is working at full steam, just ending the third session of the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/mellon-summer-institute.htm">Summer Institute in Technical Art History</a>; this year&rsquo;s topic is &ldquo;The Artist&rsquo;s Book: Materials and Processes.&rdquo; As in previous years that Institute has attracted a keen and talented group of doctoral students from all over the country to immerse themselves in this subject. That completed, our Conservation colleagues under the leadership of Professor <strong>Michele Marincola</strong> will begin the final preparations for the fourth annual <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/kress-summer-institute.htm">Summer Teachers Institute in Technical Art History</a> (July 21-25) on the ambitious and multi-facetted topic of &ldquo;The Structures of Art.&rdquo; The Institute is immensely grateful to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Samuel H. Kress Foundation for their respective support of these highly successful and influential summer programs as well as to the many colleagues and experts from other institutions who participate in the programs with their expertise and by opening their studios and labs to the students.</p>
<p>With all that going on, I am sad to say that one form of &ldquo;busy-ness&rdquo; has been blocked. It was our sincerest hope that work would begin on the conversion of the ground floor and basement spaces to create the much desired Sheldon H. Solow Study Center in No. 3 next door. Some of you may have seen the NY Times article about recent developments. The residents of the building are doing their best to stop the project. They express fears that our project will damage the property structurally and diminish its property values. It has also been suggested that NYU has a longterm plan to take over the entire building and, horror of horrors, fill it with students. This is all nonsense. Our sole purpose is to use the space that was generously given to us by the Institute&rsquo;s long-time supporter Mr. Solow. Formerly occupied by a doctor&rsquo;s office, it is suitable for the offices and study spaces that we have planned. As I have repeatedly said, the Institute&rsquo;s concern for the structural integrity and security of the building is as great or greater than that of the residents. As art and architectural historians we are acutely aware of the historic value of the town house and its context. As a graduate research institute, quiet working spaces are a top priority. We have offered the residents of No. 3 all the information about the project that they have requested and would do anything in our power to give them more details about the plan and Institute aims and operations. Our desire is to be good neighbors. The outcome of the current situation is not predictable at the moment, though one can but wish for a happy resolution.</p>
<p>On a much more cheerful note, it is with joy that we can welcome the arrival of Lydia Johnson, Sarah&rsquo;s baby girl who was born on May 27th. Congratulations to the proud parents!</p>
<p>Congratulations as well to the winners of this year&rsquo;s Decorative Arts Essay prizes: <strong>Sara C. Ferguson</strong> and <strong>Alyse Muller</strong>. To quote from Professor Flood&rsquo;s appreciation of Sarah&rsquo;s essay, <em>Classical and Christian Imagery on a Thirteenth-century Brass Pyxis</em>, &ldquo;this small and unassuming pyxis raises major questions about a body of metalwork that is canonical in the study of Islamic art.&rdquo; The essay productively revisited issues about the function of the pyxis, about centers of production, modes of patronage, intersectarian relations, and visual conventions relating to gender in the extremely complex milieu of twelfth- and thirteenth-century Syria and Mesopotamia. Alyse Muller&rsquo;s thoroughly researched paper, <em>Monkey Business: The Aristocratic Ape at the Petite Singerie of Chantilly</em>, brought us to French court culture. Decorating a boudoir, the singeries are shown to have a range of cultural meanings appropriate to a feminine ambient. Both papers were regarded by their readers as having publishable material and represent the excellence and curiosity that the Institute is proud to foster in the study of the decorative arts and in all realms of our research.</p>
<p>With a flourish of trumpets, I am pleased to make a series of announcements: first, the Institute shares <strong>Rob Lubar&rsquo;s</strong> pleasure in his year-long appointment as interim director of NYU&rsquo;s Global site in Madrid. Global can be sure that Rob will bring all of his energy and enthusiasm to this important role. I am also pleased to announce the appointment of <strong>Michele Matteini</strong> to the Department of Art History. Michele will join the Institute as an Associate Faculty member and will teach one course each year at the Institute. This is a hearty welcome back: Michele earned a Ph.D. from the Institute of Fine Arts in 2012 with a thesis entitled &ldquo;Painting in the Age of Evidential Scholarship: Luo Ping&rsquo;s Late Years, ca. 1770-1799.&rdquo; He has been awarded numerous prestigious grants, most recently one from the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. His field of study is Chinese painting from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, with a focus on the interaction between painting and antiquarian studies in the late eighteenth century. At NYU/IFA, he plans on teaching courses on the visual culture of <em>The Dream of the Red Chamber</em>, eighteenth-century cross-cultural exchanges, and antiquarianism and the arts in the early nineteenth century. </p>
<p>With gratitude to the faculty members involved, I can further announce the rotation of some of our principal administrative roles: Professor <strong>Alexander Nagel</strong> will be taking over from Professor <strong>Priscilla Soucek</strong> as Director of Graduate Studies for a three-year term; Professor <strong>Guenter Kopcke</strong> has completed his term as Director of Masters Studies and Professor <strong>Katherine Welch</strong> will take on that key job for the coming academic year; and Professor <strong>Michele Marincola</strong> is stepping down as Chair of the Conservation Center with Professor <strong>Hannelore Roemich</strong> assuming that title for a two-year term. There really are not words sufficient to express what the Institute owes to the outgoing office-holders, whose ceaseless work on behalf of our entire community has been essential to the Institute in more ways than can be listed.</p>
<p>Finally, as part of your summer&rsquo;s pleasures, don&rsquo;t miss the newly posted video on our website, <em><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/events/video-spotlight.htm">Jean-Joseph Chamant: The Lost Sketchbook</a></em>, which tells about the discovery and conservation of the eighteenth-century sketchbook found during an inventory of the library at Villa La Pietra. Led by Professor <strong>Peggy Ellis</strong>, an IFA team thoroughly examined the book for its structure, materials, and signs of how it was made and how it was used over time with exciting results that were reported at a Scholars Roundtable held at the Drawing Institute at the Morgan Library in April, hosted by the Institute, Villa La Pietra, and the Drawing Institute. This important and magnificently recovered book will now be open to further investigation. Our enterprising webmaster (and author of the film), <strong>Jason Varone</strong>, reports that the video is already attracting attention and &ldquo;although the final cut has only been public for less than a week, it is quickly becoming the most watched IFA video for this year!&rdquo; I urge you to join its admiring viewers as well as to visit <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/index.htm">our website</a> where you can catch up on many of the events of last year and find out about some of the attractions for the coming year.</p>
<p>Very best wishes to all for a pleasant and productive summer!</p>
