  The Institute of Fine Arts is pleased to announce that the spring 2014 exhibition will feature works by the acclaimed sculptor <span class="strong">Rachel Harrison</span>.</p>
<p class="content"><img class="imagecontent" src="https://files.nyu.edu/jmv5/public/rachel-harrison-institute-of-fine-arts-nyu.jpg" alt="Lynda Benglis" width="300" height="450" align="left">Rachel Harrison (b. 1966, New York) is widely known for juxtaposing quotidian cultural materials and commercial objects into irregularly shaped, bulbous forms that confuse the boundaries between abstraction and figuration. &nbsp;In Harrison's work, the figure is often implied, but never explicit.&nbsp;While her sculptures have been described as &quot;look[ing] back at the moment (or rather decades) when sculpture broke from the tradition of the statue while still attempting to invoke it,&quot; Harrison's monuments are neither commemorative nor decorous. &nbsp;Instead, they are entrenched in a critical investigation of our contemporary culture.</p>
<p class="content">In&nbsp;<span class="italic">Party Line </span>(2014), a skeletal telephone booth, constructed from wood 2x4s, houses a black pay phone dangling aimlessly from its receiver. &nbsp;International calling cards are tacked to the structure's skeletal frame, prompting viewers to complete the action or perhaps linger for the missing caller to return. Similarly, the sculpture&nbsp;<span class="italic">American Bar&nbsp;</span>(2014) reveals a&nbsp;teamster's union jacket hanging on one side of a painted, rough hewn monolith, while a gold dish scrubber is affixed to its reverse. &nbsp;Both works on view at the IFA examine the contradictory states of absence and impending presence. &nbsp;Each artwork in&nbsp;Harrison's sculptural diptych&nbsp;is allegorically completed by the viewer, either by picking up the receiver or trying on the jacket. &nbsp;Harrison's work not only confirms the importance of the beholder, but the necessity for action in a critical society.<br>

  <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/events/great-hall-exhibitions.htm">The Great Hall Exhibitions</a> present two exhibitions per year showcasing prominent contemporary artists. Taking place in the fall and spring semesters, the expansive great hall of the Duke House, a historic landmark building, provides an impressive setting for displaying seminal contemporary art in the center of the IFA’s academic home and community. </p>
